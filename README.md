## Description

A simple driver program to test the functionality of inheritance. Documentation created with Doxygen, and can be viewed by opening html/index.html in a browser.

## Compiling

Compile all .h/.cpp files using GNU (g++) compiler. 

## Execution

Upon execution, the driver will go through creating Employee, Supervisor, and Officer objects. Rates of pay and anniversarey events are tested, and each object is displayed to the standard output before and after the anniversary event.
